# -Prediction-and-Design-of-Nanozymes-using-Explainable-Machine-Learning
This project developed fully connected DNN-based model for classification and quantitative prediction of enzyme-like activity of nanomaterials by training on data
extracted from published literature. the classification model was utilized to output the enzyme-mimicking types (i.e., dependent variables), including peroxidase (POD), oxidase (OXD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities.
